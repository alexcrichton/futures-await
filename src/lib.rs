//! Runtime support for the async/await syntax for futures.
//!
//! This crate serves as a masquerade over the `futures` crate itself,
//! reexporting all of its contents. It's intended that you'll do:
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate futures_await as futures;
//! ```
//!
//! This crate adds a `prelude` module which contains various traits as well as
//! the `async` and `await` macros you'll likely want to use.
//!
//! See the crates's README for more information about usage.

/// This module has absolutely not stability at all. All contents may change at
/// any time without notice. Do not use this module in your code if you wish
